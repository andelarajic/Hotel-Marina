## Techniques used
To create this project I have used the following techniques: 
* HTML5 - It is used to define and structure the content of a web pages. It is also used to write web applications that work both online and offline.
* CSS3 - It is used to place and customize elements from HTML, for example to make an image round, to give the text in an input field a certain size or to set a background image or color.
* JavaScript - It is used to validate the input from the contact formular.
